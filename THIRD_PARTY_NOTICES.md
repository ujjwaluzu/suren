# Third-party materials

`public/art/globe-land.json` contains rounded Natural Earth 1:110m land polygons. `src/lib/globe-initial.json` contains the initial SVG projection of that map. Natural Earth data is public domain: https://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/terms-of-use/. Source: https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/blob/master/geojson/ne_110m_land.geojson. The globe uses d3-geo (ISC licence, retained in its package) for spherical projection; its SVG illustration and animation are original code.

`scripts/lib/iso-kit.mjs` is from the Anatomy skill by its respective contributors, supplied under the MIT licence. It is used only to precompute the original brand illustration in `scripts/build-brand.mjs`.

The home page uses self-hosted Anton (The Anton Project Authors), Manrope (The Manrope Project Authors), and IBM Plex Mono (IBM Corp.), distributed through Fontsource under the SIL Open Font License 1.1. Their licence files are included alongside the fonts in `public/fonts/`.

The original five home page illustrations in `public/art/` are WebP conversions of the artwork supplied in `suren-home-redesign/assets/`. The `*-transparent.webp` versions were edited with the built-in image generation tool to remove their backgrounds, then optimised as WebP while preserving transparency. The supplied originals are retained.

The `glitch-halftone-transparent.webp` variant was restyled with the same tool to match the site's black-and-cream halftone sticker artwork. The source, style references and prompt are documented in `docs/glitch-art-theme.json`.

The `mech-halftone-transparent.webp` variant uses the same black-and-cream halftone sticker treatment. Its source, style references and prompt are documented in `docs/mech-art-theme.json`.

The hero globe in `globe-halftone-transparent.webp` was restyled from the supplied `eb023b6985ea6699a0d710ed11aecd8e.jpg` reference with the same tool, replacing its baked-in checkerboard with transparency. Its source, style references and prompt are documented in `docs/globe-art-theme.json`.
